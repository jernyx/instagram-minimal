/**
 * Instagram wraps a signing certificate's SHA-256 in a "key hash" (Base64, 43 chars) via
 * X.3uq, keeps Meta's trusted key hashes in a static allowlist in X.1eX, and exposes two
 * membership checks:
 *
 *   - X.1eX.A01(keyHash)          -> keyHash in allowlist
 *   - X.1eY.A01(keyHash, ref, z)  -> family-app scope trust (with the same allowlist fallback)
 *
 * Re-signing the APK produces a key hash that is not in the allowlist, so both checks fail,
 * X.0XS.A02 (the "is this APK signed by Meta" gate) turns false, and Instagram's deep-link
 * dispatcher silently drops navigation to the linked content (issue #36).
 *
 * Both methods take the X.3uq key-hash type, so they are matched structurally after locating
 * that type by its stable error string. The obfuscated class/method names therefore never
 * appear in this patch and it survives Instagram renaming them between releases.
